<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In simple words, is a <strong> flatbread made with wholemeal wheat flour.</strong></p>
<p>It took me several years to learn to how to make a good roti. Trust me, it&apos;s a skill which needs a lot of practice.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups atta whole wheat flour, 270 grams + 1/4 cup for rolling the roti</li>
    <li>1-2 teaspoons oil optional, 5-10 ml</li>
    <li>water as needed to knead a soft dough, I used around 3/4 cup (180 ml) + 1 tablespoon (15 ml)</li>
    <li>ghee to brush the rotis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<!--Nested lists-->
<ol>
    <li><strong>Knead the dough</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Take 2 cups (270 grams) atta in a large bowl. Usually a round flat plate with shallow edges called paraat is used but I just had a round mixing bowl so that's what I used.</li>
            <li>Start adding water, little by little. As you add water, mix with your hands and bring the dough together. I needed around 3/4 cup (180 ml) +1 tablespoon (15 ml) water here. You may need more or less water depending on the kind of flour.</li>
            <li>Once the dough comes together, start kneading the dough. Knead with the knuckles of your finger, applying pressure.</li>
            <li><pre>Fold the dough using your palms and knead again applying pressure with your knuckles.
                Keep kneading until the dough feels soft and pliable. If it feels hard/tight, add little water and knead again. If it feels too sticky/soft, add some dry flour and mix.</pre></li>
            <li>Once done, the dough should be smooth. Press the dough with your fingers, it should leave an impression.</li>
            <li><pre>Cover the dough with a damp cloth or paper towel for 20 to 30 minutes.
                I placed my paper towel under tap water and then squeezed all the water from it and used that damp paper towel to cover the cloth.</pre></li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Roll the roti</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><pre>After the dough has rested, give it a quick knead again.
                Divide the dough into 12 equal parts, each weighing around 35 to 37 grams.</pre></li>
            <li>Start working with one ball, while keep the remaining dough balls covered with a damp cloth so that they don't dry out.</li>
            <li>Take one of the balls and press it between your fingers to make it smooth. Then roll it between your palms to make it round and smooth. There should be no cracks. Press the round dough ball and flatten it slightly.</li>
            <li>Now take around 1/4 cup atta in a plate for dusting the roti while rolling it. Dip the prepared dough ball into the dry flour and dust it from all sides.</li>
            <li>Then start rolling the roti, using a rolling board and rolling pin.</li>
            <li>You can also roll a little and then take the roti and move it a little with your hands and roll again. Roll it thin until you have a 5 to 6 inch diameter circular roti.
                You will have to dip the roti in dry flour several time while rolling the roti. Anytime the dough starts sticking to the rolling pin, dip the roti into the atta from both sides and then continue rolling.</li>
            </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cook the roti</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the tawa (skillet) on medium-high heat. Make sure the tawa is hot enough before you place the roti on the tawa.</li>
            <li>Let it cook for 15-30 seconds until you see some bubbles on top side. At this point flip the roti, you don't want the first side to cook too much. </li>
            <li>Now, remove the roti from the tawa using a tong and place it directly on flame with the first side (which was little less cooked) directly on the flame.</li>
            <li>Apply ghee on the rotis immediately. Make all the roti/phulka similarly. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
