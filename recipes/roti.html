<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In simple words, is a <strong> flatbread made with wholemeal wheat flour.</strong></p>
<p>It took me several years to learn to how to make a good roti. Trust me, it&apos;s a skill which needs a lot of practice.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups atta whole wheat flour, 270 grams + 1/4 cup for rolling the roti</li>
    <li>1-2 teaspoons oil optional, 5-10 ml</li>
    <li>water as needed to knead a soft dough, I used around 3/4 cup (180 ml) + 1 tablespoon (15 ml)</li>
    <li>ghee to brush the rotis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Knead the dough
        <ol>
            <li>Take 2 cups (270 grams) atta in a large bowl. Usually a round flat plate with shallow edges called paraat is used but I just had a round mixing bowl so that's what I used.</li>
            <li>Start adding water, little by little. As you add water, mix with your hands and bring the dough together. I needed around 3/4 cup (180 ml) +1 tablespoon (15 ml) water here. You may need more or less water depending on the kind of flour.</li>
            <li>Once the dough comes together, start kneading the dough. Knead with the knuckles of your finger, applying pressure.</li>
            <li><pre>Fold the dough using your palms and knead again applying pressure with your knuckles.
                Keep kneading until the dough feels soft and pliable. If it feels hard/tight, add little water and knead again. If it feels too sticky/soft, add some dry flour and mix.</pre></li>
            <li>Once done, the dough should be smooth. Press the dough with your fingers, it should leave an impression.</li>
            <li><pre>Cover the dough with a damp cloth or paper towel for 20 to 30 minutes.
                I placed my paper towel under tap water and then squeezed all the water from it and used that damp paper towel to cover the cloth.</pre></li>
