<h2>MEXICAN TACOS INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Traditional Mexican beef tacos are made with marinated sliced or shredded beef on soft corn tortillas.  Those are great!  But, that&apos;s not what most Americans think of when we think of classic tacos.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<!--an unordered list-->
<ul>
    <li>lb. 90% to 93% lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon chili powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>12 taco shells</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

    <li>Add the beef to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Break the meat apart with a wooden spoon. Add the chili powder, cumin, salt, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper to the meat. Stir well. Cook until the meat is cooked through, about 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the tomato sauce and water. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 7-8 minutes, until some of the liquid evaporates but the meat mixture is still a little saucy. Remove from the heat.</li>
    <li>Warm the taco shells according to their package directions.</li>
    <li>Fill the taco shells with 2 heaping tablespoons of taco meat. Top with desired taco toppings: shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, diced red onion, taco sauce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.</li>
</ol>
